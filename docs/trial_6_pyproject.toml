# Trial 6 (trial_6_coke_db) – uv config template
# Copy this file to your trial folder as pyproject.toml, then run: uv sync
#
# Path to dvt-core: use ONE of the following in [tool.uv.sources] below:
#   - Relative (if trial is under Testing_Playground and dvt-core is a sibling of Testing_Playground):
#       path = "../../dvt-core/core"
#   - Absolute (replace with your real path):
#       path = "/Users/hex/Documents/My_Projects/DVT/dvt-core/core"
#
# IMPORTANT: Run "uv sync" and "uv run dvt ..." from the TRIAL folder (trial_6_coke_db),
# not from Coke_DB/. The pyproject.toml with this path source must be in the trial root.
